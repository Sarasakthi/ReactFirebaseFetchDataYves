# Wednesday

What started as a simple introduction to JasvaScript asynchronous functions in a React class on cold Wednesday night...

A progression from a fetch inside a useEffect to adding a catch clause to using useEffect cleanup function to using React Query.

## Usage

- clone this repository
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- use your favourite editor/IDE to study the ordinal jsx files (First.jsx, Second.jsx etc...)

You can also replace your `App.jsx` from the default Vite JavaScript React template with one of the ordinal jsx files.
